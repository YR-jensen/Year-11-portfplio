    Hello everyone! I'm excited to meet you all here. My name is Jensen11year, and I'm from China. I am deeply interested in technology and innovation, especially learning about emerging technologies and scientific discoveries. In addition to English and mathematics, I also enjoy reading books, particularly those on history and philosophy, as they help me better understand the world and human development.

In my daily life, I also love sports, especially running and playing basketball. Sports keep me energized and improve my teamwork skills. I believe that balancing academics, hobbies, and physical activities helps me grow better.

I look forward to connecting with all of you, learning from each other, and progressing together! If you're interested in any topic, feel free to share your thoughts with me!
